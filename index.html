        <h3>I started coming to Geekwise because I didn't really know what I wanted to do for a career. I always liked and was widly fascinated by technology, and after being introduced to 'hacking' and coding on shows Scorpion and Mr Robot I was more interested. So I researched a little and learned about bootcamp schools that specify on coding. I was lucky to come across Geekwise after searching on google for bootcamps and really glad to sign up and started taking classes. I already learned SO much from taking websites for beginners and really enjoy it and super excited to continue to learn and prepare myself to start my career as a devolper! </h3>
